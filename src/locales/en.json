  "search_tips": "\n<b>Search</b>\n• You can change search sorting by adding <code>/s</code><I>p</i> before the search query, where <i>p</i> - means by <b>p</b>opular or <i>n</i> - by <b>n</b>ew, for example: <code>/sp sex toys</code>\n• You can specify page number by adding <code>/p</code>[<i>n</i>] before the search query, where <i>n</i> - page number, for example: <code>/p5 sex toys</code>\n• You can search for multiple terms at the same time, and this will return only galleries that contain both terms. For example, <code>anal tanlines</code> finds all galleries that contain both anal and tanlines.\n• You can exclude terms by prefixing them with <code>-</code>. For example, anal tanlines -yaoi matches all galleries matching anal and tanlines but not yaoi.\n• Exact searches can be performed by wrapping terms in double quotes. For example, <code>\"big breasts\"</code> only matches galleries with <i>\"big breasts\"</i> somewhere in the title or in tags.\n• These can be combined with tag namespaces for finer control over the query: <code>parodies:railgun -tag: \"big breast\"</code>.\n• You can search for galleries with a specific number of pages with pages: 20, or with a page range: <code>pages:&gt;20 pages:&lt;=30.</code>\n• You can search for galleries uploaded within some timeframe with <code>uploaded: 20d</code>. Valid units are h, d, w, m, y.\n• You can use ranges as well: <code>uploaded:>20d uploaded:&lt;30d.</code>"
